        Say hello to the best react form library you have ever used! Informed is

      <Info>
        First lets take a look at whats possible with informed. Below is an
        example where we wrapped informed around Adobe's{' '}
        <a href="https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/index.html">
          desgin-system
        </a>
        .
      </Info>
      <Info type="notice">
        Those components got defined once inside `YourComponents` directory. You
        will see how this was done later inside the{' '}
        <Link href="/getting-started/setup">setup</Link> docs.
      </Info>
      <SideBySide
        leftHeader={<Hint />}
        rightHeader={<h3>Code:</h3>}
        left={<FirstExample />}
        right={<Code links input1={firstExampleCode} />}
      />
      <Info>
        Whats going on here? Basically informed manages form state for you, and
        allows you to easily hook ito its state managemenet with the use of
        <code>useField</code>
        <br />
        <br />
        Above, we imported inputs that were already wrapped and simply rendered
        them on the page.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>This is the way!</strong> You should most of the time not even
        realize you are using a form library üòÅ

      <h1>How do I start!?</h1>
      <Info>
        In order to use informed all you need to do is wrap your own inputs with
        informed via a `useField` hook.
      </Info>
      {/* <Code>{` const { fieldApi, fieldState } = useField(props);
<Input name="name" label="Name" required />`}</Code> */}

        You do this one time and then can use your form inputs as normal JSX or
